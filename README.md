# 2DPlatformerCharacterControllerCodeUnity
 A character controller and collision detection system for unity games. 
 
 The controller uses raycasting for collision detection, and the raycast sources are dependent on a BoxCollider2D object attatched to the player character. Classes are seperated based on the function that they perform.
 
 All relevant attributes for changing player movement are accessible from the inspector. 
 
 
 FEATURES INCLUDE:
 
 Collision detection using raycasts
 
 Jump arc calculation
 
 Moving platforms
 
 Drop through platforms
 
 Player velocity calculation
 
 Smooth movement up and down slopes calculated using Trigonometric functions
 
 Player slides down slopes when the slope angle reaches above a set maximum
